```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#readr is part of tidyverse
```


Let's import a dataset. 

```{r}
litters_df = 
  read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")

#dont use read.csv it is not as good as read_csv
```

Always look at your data

```{r}
names(litters_df)
```

Accessing variable names that have spaces in it is very hard. 
So update the names in `litter_df`.

```{r}
litters_df=
  janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

#this makes everything snakecase. snake case makes it easier to use variable names in code
```


Look at the data. Most frequent thing jeff does is print the data and view the data set (from console) 

```{r}
litters_df
#<dbl> means that it is a double numeric value
#you can use (view litters_df in console to get a pop up of dataset)
```


Sometimes skimming data is neat?
```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
```
